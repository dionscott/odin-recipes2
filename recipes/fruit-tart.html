        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Loaded with a lush assortment of seasonal berries and other fruit, there's nothing quite as lovely as a Fresh Fruit Tart. You'll also learn some baking basics along the way.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2c whole milk</li>
            <li>1c white sugar</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/4c cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pint of fresh cut fruit (your choice)</li>
            <li>Apricot jam, melted</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium non-aluminum saucepan over medium heat, heat milk until tiny bubbles appear on the surface, about 6 to 8 minutes (180 degrees). Stir to prevent scalding.</li>   
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar.</li>
            <li>Whisk in cornstarch and salt. While whisking constantly, pour in half of the hot milk.</li>
            <li>Whisk in remaining hot milk and return to saucepan.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens to a firm consistency, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk in vanilla and pour in to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly on to the surface of the pastry cream. Refrigerate until chilled, about 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Fill cooled tart crust with chilled pastry cream. Arrange fruit in a decorative pattern.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry brush, brush fruit with melted apricot glaze (reheat as necessary if glaze cools and becomes too sticky).</li>
        </ol>
